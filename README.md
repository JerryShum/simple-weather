# Simple Weather App

## Introduction

Welcome to my Simple Weather App! This project was created as a learning exercise to explore React hooks, specifically the `useEffect` hook, and how to handle API data. The app fetches weather data from the Visual Crossing Weather API and provides a 7-day forecast for the user's current location.

## Features

- **React Hooks**: Utilizes the `useEffect` hook to manage side effects and fetch data.
- **API Integration**: Fetches weather data from the Visual Crossing Weather API.
- **User Location**: Requests the user's location to display weather information for their current area.
- **7-Day Forecast**: Displays a 7-day weather forecast.
